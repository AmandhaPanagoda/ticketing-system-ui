    <p class="doc-subtitle">
      This guide will walk you through how to purchase tickets, how the system operates, and areas I
      plan to improve. I've made it simple yet efficient‚Äîread on to learn more.

  <!-- Customer Process -->
  <section>
    <h2>üîÑ Customer Process</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Step 1: View the Ticket Pool</h3>
      <p>
        On your <b>Buy Tickets</b> screen, you‚Äôll see the
        <strong>current number of tickets</strong> available in the pool displayed in real-time.
        This is powered by WebSockets, so the pool count updates instantly whenever tickets are
        added or purchased.
      </p>
      <p class="tip">
        üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> The live display ensures you know exactly how many tickets you can
        purchase.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Step 2: Purchase Tickets</h3>
      <p>
        Below the ticket pool display, there‚Äôs an input field where you can enter the number of
        tickets you wish to purchase. The system checks to ensure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are not requesting more tickets than are currently available in the pool.</li>
        <li>The ticket pool is active (only the admin can start or stop it).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="alert">
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid requests (e.g., requesting too many tickets or if the system is inactive) will be
        rejected.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Step 3: See What Happens Behind the Scenes</h3>
      <p>Once you submit a valid purchase request:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tickets are allocated to you on a <strong>First-In-First-Out (FIFO)</strong> basis from
          the ticket queue.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ticket pool count is updated immediately, visible to all vendors and customers in
          real-time.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Viewing Purchase History -->
  <section>
    <h2>üìú Viewing Purchase History</h2>
    <p>A purchase history table is provided below the purchase input to track:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All tickets you‚Äôve purchased.</li>
      <li>The vendor who sold each ticket.</li>
      <li>Timestamp of each purchase.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Filter tickets by vendor or timestamp.</li>
      <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Easily navigate through long purchase histories.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Important Things to Know -->
  <section>
    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Things to Know</h2>
    <p><strong>System Limitations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Supports a single event only.
        <ul>
          <li>All customers purchase tickets for the same event.</li>
          <li>
            <b>WHY?</b> This approach simplifies the system and focuses on core functionality, such
            as multi-threading and real-time updates, as required by the project.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed Ticket Properties
        <ul>
          <li>Tickets are uniform (no pricing or type variations).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Program Reset Behavior
        <ul>
          <li>When the system is down (server is down), the ticket pool resets.</li>
          <li>
            Your purchase history will be saved in the database, but the pool resets when the
            program restarts.
          </li>
          <p class="info">
            ‚ÑπÔ∏è This section is a bit tricky. The customer will see the old tickets they bought in
            the table.<br />
            This is because the table shows all data not just the tickets bought in the current
            session.<br />
            I do not load the unsold tickets back to the queue when the program stops, this is to
            make it less confusing, but this also means customers can't buy the unsold tickets which
            were not sold in the previous session.
          </p>
          <p class="alert">
            ‚ö†Ô∏è Program stopping behavior: When the java program is stopped (i.e. backend is
            completely down). Once this is restarted the pool will be reset. <br />
            System Status: When admin stops/ starts the pool. This can be restarted and won't affect
            the flow. <br />
            <b>DO NOT CONFUSE THE TWO.</b> One is program stopping, other is just stopping the pool.
          </p>

  <!--Why We Designed It This Way-->
  <section>
    <h2>ü§î Why I Designed It This Way</h2>
    <p>
      This system was built with a focus on core project requirements, such as multi-threading,
      real-time updates, and a centralized ticket pool. Here‚Äôs why:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A single event simplifies interactions between vendors and customers, focusing on a shared
        ticket pool.
      </li>
      <li>Real-time updates ensure all users see the latest status without delays.</li>
      <li>Thread-safe operations prevent conflicts during ticket additions and purchases.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Future Improvements -->
  <section>
    <h2>üöÄ Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Multi-Event Support:</strong> Allow customers to buy tickets for different events.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> Enable pricing flexibility based on demand or time.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customer Profiles:</strong> Let customers create profiles to track their purchase
        history over multiple sessions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Persistent Data:</strong> Save purchase histories across program restarts for better
        tracking <i>(right now, it's saved in the database).</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Analytics:</strong> Provide customers with insights, such as purchase
        trends and recommendations.
      </li>
    </ul>
