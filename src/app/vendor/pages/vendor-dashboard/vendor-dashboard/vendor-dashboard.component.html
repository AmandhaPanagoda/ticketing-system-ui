    <h1>üìÑ Vendor Guide: How the Ticketing System Works</h1>
    <p class="doc-subtitle">
      This document explains how vendors can add tickets, how the system works, why it was designed
      this way, and what could be improved in the future. I have kept things simple but powerful,
      and here‚Äôs all you need to know.

  <!-- Vendor Process -->
  <section>
    <h2>üîÑ Vendor Process</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Step 1: View the Ticket Pool</h3>
      <p>
        On your vendor screen, you‚Äôll see the <strong>current number of tickets</strong> in the pool
        displayed in real-time. Powered by WebSockets, updates occur instantly every time tickets
        are added or purchased.
      </p>
      <p class="tip">
        üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Live tracking ensures you know how many tickets you can still add.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Step 2: Add Tickets</h3>
      <p>
        Below the ticket pool display, there‚Äôs an input field where you can enter the number of
        tickets to add. The system checks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the total tickets in the pool plus your new tickets exceed the maximum capacity set by
          the admin.
        </li>
        <li>If the ticket pool is active (only the admin can start or stop it).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="alert">
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid requests (e.g., too many tickets or system off) will be rejected.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Step 3: See What Happens Behind the Scenes</h3>
      <p>Once you submit a valid request:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It goes through semaphore-based concurrency processing. This means even if many vendors
          are adding tickets at the same time, the system ensures everything happens smoothly
          without conflicts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tickets are added if space is available, and the updated pool count is visible to everyone
          instantly.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <!-- Viewing Sales History -->
  <section>
    <h2>üìú Viewing Sales History</h2>
    <p>A sales history table is provided below the release button to track:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All tickets you've added.</li>
      <li>Whether tickets are purchased or unsold.</li>
      <li>Who purchased them (customer info like ID/name).</li>
      <li>Timestamp of each sale.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Filter tickets by purchase status.</li>
      <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Navigate long histories easily.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Important Things to Know -->
  <section>
    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Things to Know</h2>
    <p><strong>System Limitations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Supports a single event only.
        <ul>
          <li>Right now, all vendors add tickets for the same event.</li>
          <li>
            I imagined of this as a concert venue where multiple ticket sellers (like
            <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com" target="_blank">Ticketmaster</a> and partners)
            sell tickets for one big concert.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>WHY?</b> Because I wanted to keep the system simple while focusing on things like
            multi-threading and ticket pooling, as required.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Ticket properties (e.g., pricing, types) are fixed.
        <ul>
          <li>Tickets don‚Äôt have customizable features like pricing or types.</li>
          <li>This is intentional to keep the focus on core functionality.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Admin Control
        <ul>
          <li>Vendors can only add tickets when the admin has started the system.</li>
          <li>If the system is inactive, ticket addition is blocked.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Program Reset Behavior
        <ul>
          <li>When the admin stops the system, the ticket pool resets.</li>
          <li>
            Your sales history (including unsold tickets) will be saved in the Database, but ticket
            pool will be gone if the program is stopped.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>WHY?</b> This design showcases object-oriented programming principles, where data
            resets for simplicity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p class="info">
        ‚ÑπÔ∏è This section is a bit tricky. The vendor will see the old tickets they sold/unsold in the
        table however that number will not reflect in the pool monitor.<br />
        This is because the table shows all data not just current status.<br />
        I do not load the unsold tickets back to the queue when the program stops, this is to make
        it less confusing.
      </p>
      <p class="alert">
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Program stopping behavior: When the java program is stopped (i.e. backend is completely
        down). Once this is restarted the pool will be reset.<br />
        System Status: When admin stops/ starts the pool. This can be restarted and won't affect the
        flow. <br />
        <b>DO NOT CONFUSE THE TWO.</b> One is program stopping, other is just stopping the pool.
      </p>
    </ul>

  <!--Why I designed it this way-->
  <section>
    <h2>ü§î Why I Designed It This Way</h2>
    <p>
      I had to focus on multi-threading and a ticket pool as part of the coursework.<br />
      Allowing multiple events would complicate the system unnecessarily, so I stuck to one event
      where vendors add tickets in bulk. <br />The system is designed for speed and real-time
      updates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Vendors and customers interact with the same ticket pool using a first-come, first-serve
        basis.
      </li>
      <li>WebSockets ensure everyone sees updates instantly.</li>
      <li>
        Thread-based concurrency ensures all ticket additions and purchases happen smoothly without
        clashes.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Future Improvements -->
  <section>
    <h2>üöÄ Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Multi-Event Support:</strong> Let vendors add tickets for different events, each
        with its own pool and properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> Add options for flexible pricing based on demand or time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vendor Customization:</strong> Let vendors customize profiles and add personal
        branding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advanced Analytics:</strong> Include a dashboard for vendors to track sales trends,
        performance metrics, and customer insights. (admin have something similar at the moment üòâ)
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section>
    <h2>‚úÖ Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This system is designed for simplicity and efficiency, showcasing multi-threading, real-time
      updates, and admin-controlled operations. With enhancements, it could become a versatile
      platform for real-world ticketing systems.
